## oauth-route-middleware

This is the documentation page of oauth-route-middleware. This Apache Camel 4 project uses [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) and the [Camel DHIS2 component](https://camel.apache.org/components/4.4.x/dhis2-component.html).

From your terminal, within the project root directory path, enter `mvn clean package` to build the project. Enter `mvn clean package -DskipTests` to build the project without running the test suite. The test suite starts Docker containers so you should skip the tests if you do not have [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/) installed locally. Project settings like the DHIS2 server address can be changed from `application.yaml` in `src/main/resources`. Alternatively, you can override the settings when launching the application as [documented](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/reference/features/external-config.html#features.external-config.files) in the Spring Boot website.

Run `java -jar target/oauth-route-middleware-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` to launch the application from your terminal. If you included [Hawtio](https://hawt.io/) during archetype generation, the web console can be opened from `http://127.0.0.1:9070/management/hawtio`. Note that the default username is `user` and the default password will be printed in the terminal at the time when your application starts.
